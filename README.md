# elm-refactor

A refactoring tool for [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

# Not yet released

I was working on this pre-COVID, but the initial release is still currently on hold.

If you found this because you're trying to use [elm-upgrade](https://github.com/avh4/elm-upgrade)
to upgrade a project from Elm 0.18 to Elm 0.19, use the following workaround:
- Install an older version of elm-format `npm install -g elm-format@0.8.4`
- Do your upgrade with elm-upgrade
- Reinstall the latest version of elm-format `npm install -g elm-format`
